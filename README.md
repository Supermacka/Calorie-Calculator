# Calorie-Calculator
Enter the ingredients of a recipe and get the amount of calories (per 100g). 

It's important to know the amount of calories that are in your food. Staying healthy and getting the right intake of klories for your body.
The program uses google to searh through the specified html-source and finding the corresponding kcal amount for the ingredients. I'm hoping to able to use this project for later  larger programs.
